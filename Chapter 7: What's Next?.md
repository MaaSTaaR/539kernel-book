# Chapter 7: What's Next? {#ch-wthat-is-next}

## Introduction
And now, after writing a simple operating system kernel and learning the basics of creating kernels, the question is "What's Next?". Obviously, there is a lot to do after creating the 539kernel and the most straightforward answers to our question are the basic well-known answers, such as: implementing virtual memory, enabling the user-space environment, providing a graphical user interface or porting the kernel to another architecture (e.g. ARM architecture). This list is a short list of what you can do next with your kernel.

Previously, I've introduced the term *kernelist* ^[In chapter \ref{ch-progenitor} where the distinction between a kernelist and a traditionalist has been established.] by which I mean a person who works on designing operating system kernels with modern innovative solutions to solve real-world problems. You can continue with your hobby kernel and implement the well-known concepts of traditional operating systems some of which we've just mentioned, but if you want to create something that can be more useful and special than a traditional kernel, then I think you should consider playing the role of a kernelist.

If you take a quick look at the current hobby or even production operating system kernels through GitHub for example, you will find most of them are traditional, that is, they focus on implementing the traditional ideas that are well-known in operating systems world. Some of those kernels go further and try to emulate another previous operating systems, for example, many of them are Unix-like kernels, that is, they try to emulate Unix. Another examples are ReactOS^[<https://reactos.org/>] which tries to emulate Microsoft Windows and Haiku^[<https://www.haiku-os.org/>] which tries to emulate BeOS which is a discontinued proprietary operating system. Trying to emulate another operating systems is good and has advantages of course, but what I'm trying to say is that there are a lot of projects that focus on this line of operating systems development, that is, the traditionalists line and I think the line of kernelists needs to come into more focus in order to produce more innovative operating systems.

I've already said that the kernelist doesn't need to propose their own solutions for the problems that they'd like to solve. Instead of using the old well-known solutions, a kernelist searches for other better solutions for the given problem and designs an operating system kernel that uses these solutions. Scientific papers (papers for short) are the best place to find novel and innovative ideas that solve real-world problems, most probably, these ideas haven't been implemented or adopted by others yet^[Scientific papers can be searched for through a dedicated search engine, for example, Google Scholar.].

In this chapter, I've chosen a bunch of scientific papers that propose new solutions for real-world problems and I'll show you a high-level overview of these solutions. My goal is to encourage interested people to start looking into the scientific papers and implement their solutions to be used in the real-world. Also, I'd like to show how the researchers in the operating systems field (or simply the kernelists!) innovate clever solutions and overcome the challenges. This could help an interested person in learning how to overcome their own challenges and propose innovative solutions for the problem that they face.

Of course, the ideas in the papers that we're going to discuss (or even the other operating system's papers) may need more than a simple kernel such as the 539kernel to be implemented. For example, some ideas may need a networking stack being available in the kernel, which is not available in the 539kernel, so, there will be two options in this case: either you implement a networking stack in your kernel or you can simply focus on the problem and the solution that a paper presents and use an already existing operating system kernel which has the required features to develop the solution with the help and on top of the chosen kernel. Of course, there are many open source options and one of them is the HelenOS^[<http://www.helenos.org/>] microkernel^[The concept of a *microkernel* will be explained in this chapter.].

It should be mentioned that this chapter only shows an overview of each paper which means that if you're really interested in the problem and the solution that a given paper represents, then it's better to read it yourself. It's easy to get a copy of the mentioned papers in this chapter, you just need to search for the title in Google Scholar (<https://scholar.google.com/>) and a link to a PDF will be presented to you. However, before getting started discussing the chosen papers, in the next subsection I'd like to discuss a topic that I've deferred up to this point. This topic is related to the architecture design of a kernel.

### The Design of Kernel's Architecture: Monolithic vs. Microkernel
The architecture of an operating system, as the one of any other software, can be designed in many different ways. The most commonly known kernel architectures are the *monolithic kernel* and the *microkernel*. When a kernel is designed according to the monolithic architecture, the whole code of the kernel runs in kernel-mode, that is, all the code of the kernel (hence, all its different modules) has the same privileges to perform any operation and to change anything in the system, even the device drivers. A notable example of a monolithic kernel is Linux, also, the modern BSD family (FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD) uses the monolithic architecture, the original Unix itself used a monolithic kernel. As you may notice, the 539kernel is also a monolithic kernel.

The other well-known design is a microkernel, where not every component of an operating system kernel is executed as privileged code (in kernel-mode). Instead, only the code that really needs to perform privileged instructions runs in kernel-mode, the other parts of the kernel that don't need to perform privileged instructions are separated from the microkernel and run in user-mode like any other user application. They are known as *servers* in the microkernel architecture. The goal of those servers is to provide an interface that represents the kernel services for the user applications, and when a privileged instruction needs to be performed, the server communicates with the microkernel which runs in kernel-mode to do so. For example, when a user process needs to create a new process, it needs to communicate with *processes server* which runs in user-mode and requests from the server to create a new process. The processes server maintains the list of processes and their process control blocks since these data structures don't need to be in the kernel-mode or kernel's address space. So, when a process creation request arrives, the creation of a new entry for the new process will be the responsibility of the processes server with no need to run any privileged code. Once privileged code is needed, the microkernel will be called by the server.

Let's take the process management module of the 539kernel as an example. This module provides one function which is `process_create` in `process.c`, if you read the code of this module you'll see that there's not one part of it that needs to run in kernel-mode. That means, if the 539kernel was a microkernel, this whole module could run as a userspace server instead of being in the kernel itself. Another example from the 539kernel is the scheduler, you can see for example in the function `scheduler` (`scheduler.c`) that there's no need to run it in the kernel-mode, so, if the 539kernel was a microkernel, this module could be run as a separate userspace server instead. If you review the code of `scheduler` carefully, you can see that it needs to reach the processes list and also needs to modify the process control block, that means the scheduler server needs to communicate with the processes server to perform these operations. In microkernels this can be done through message passing, for example, the scheduler server can send a message to the processes server to get the list of ready processes or to change some attribute in a process control block and so on, the same is applicable between the other servers. The function `run_next_process` in `scheduler.c` is an example from the 539kernel's scheduler module that needs to run as privileged code, so, if the 539kernel was a microkernel this function should reside in the kernel itself and not in the scheduler server. Another example in the 539kernel that should be in the kernel itself instead of in a server is the interrupt handler `isr_32` in `idt.asm`.

The goal of the microkernel design is to keep the code that needs to run as privileged code as small as possible and to move all the other code to the userspace. This can make the kernel itself more secure, reliable and easier to debug. Microkernels have a long history of research to improve their performance and make them better. There are many microkernels available nowadays, for example, L4, Mach which has been used in the NeXTSTEP operating system that the current is macOS based on ^[Though, macOS' kernel is considered as a hybrid kernel and not a microkernel.], Minix, HelenOS and Zircon which is the kernel of the Fuchsia operating system. Maybe one of the most famous things related to microkernels is a debate known as the *Tanenbaumâ€“Torvalds debate* between Andrew S. Tanenbaum (the creator of Minix and the author of the book "Operating Systems: Design and Implementation") and Linus Torvalds (the creator of Linux) in 1992, a few months after the release of the Linux kernel^[The title of the post which started the debate was "LINUX is obsolete" by Andrew Tanenbaum. The text of the debate is available online here: <https://www.oreilly.com/openbook/opensources/book/appa.html>].

## In-Process Isolation
In current operating systems, any part of a process can read from and write to any place in the same process' memory. Consider a web browser which like any other application consists of a number of different modules (in the perspective of programmers) and each one of them handles different functionality, the rendering engine is one example of web browser's module which is responsible for parsing HTML and drawing the components of the page in front of the user. When an application is represented as a process, there will be no such distinction from the perspective of a kernel, all modules of an application are considered as one big chunk of code and each part has the permission to do anything that any other part of the same process can do.

For example, in a web browser, the module that stores the list of web pages that you are visiting right now is able to access the data that is stored by the module which handles your credit card number when you issue an online payment. As you can see, the first module is much less critical than the second one and unfortunately if an attacker can somehow hack the first module through an exploitable security bug, they will be able to read the data of the second module, that is, your credit card information and nothing is going to stop them.

This happens due to the lack of *in-process isolation* in the current operating systems. This means that both sensitive and insensitive parts of the data of the same process are stored in the same address space and any part of the process code is permitted to access all this data. There's no difference in your web browser's process between the memory region which stores that titles of the pages and the region which stores your credit card information. A severe security bug known as the *HeartBleed vulnerability*^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed] showed up due to the lack of in-process isolation. Next, two of the solutions for the problem of data isolation that have been proposed by kernelists will be discussed.

### Lord of x86 Rings
A paper named "Lord of the x86 Rings: A Portable User Mode Privilege Separation Architecture on x86" ^[Authored by Hojoon Lee, Chihyun Song and Brent Byunghoon Kang. Published in 2018.] proposes an architecture (named LOTRx86 for short) which provides in-process isolation. The paper uses the term *user-mode privilege separation* which has the same meaning. LOTRx86 doesn't use new features of modern processors to implement in-process isolation, Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX) is an example of such a feature. The reason of not using such modern features in LOTRx86 is portability, while SGX is supported in Intel's processors, it's not implemented in AMD's processors^[Besides Intel, AMD also provides processors that use the x86 architecture.] which means that employing this feature will make a kernel only work on Intel's processors and not AMD's. Besides that, SGX is a relatively new technology^[Intel's SGX is deprecated on Intel Core processors but is still available on Intel Xeons.] which means that even older Intel processors don't support it and that makes a kernel less portable so that they can only run on specific types of Intel processors. So, if we would like to provide in-process isolation in a kernel, but at the same time, we would like it to work on both Intel's and AMD's processors, that is, being portable ^[In LOTRx86 when the term *portable* is used to describe something it means that this thing is able to work on any modern x86 processor. The same term has another broader meaning, for example, we could say that "the Linux kernel is *portable*", by which we would mean that it works on multiple processor architectures such as x86, ARM and a lot more and not only on Intel's or AMD's x86.], what should we do? According to LOTRx86, we use privilege levels to do that.

Throughout this book, we have encountered x86 privilege levels and we know from our previous discussions that modern operating systems only use the most privileged level `0` as kernel-mode and the least privileged level `3` as user-mode. In LOTRx86 a new area in each process called *PrivUser* is introduced, this area keeps the sensitive data of the process and it's only accessible through special code that runs in the privilege level `2`, so, in a kernel which employs LOTRx86 a process may run in privilege level `3` (user-mode), as in modern operating systems, and may run in privilege level `2` (PrivUser). Most of the normal work of a process will be done in level `3`, but when the code is related to sensitive data, such as storing, accessing, or processing it, the process will run in level `2`. Of course, the sensitive data cannot be accessed by the process' normal code since the latter runs in level `3` and the former needs code that runs in privilege level `2` to be accessed. If an attacker exploits a vulnerability that allows them to read the memory of the process, they won't be able to read the secret data if this vulnerability is in the unprivileged part of the code of the process.

A kernel with LOTRx86 should provide a way for the programmers to use the functionality provided by LOTRx86, so, the authors of the paper propose a programming interface named *privcall* which works like Linux kernel's system calls. Through this interface an application programmer can write functions (routines) that process the secret data, these functions will run in privilege level `2` and will be stored with the privileges of PrivUser, we will call these functions *secret functions* in our coming discussion. When the unprivileged code of the process needs to do something with some secret data that is stored with the privileges of PrivUser a specific privileged function can be called through the `privcall` interface. Once this call is issued, the current privilege level will be changed from `3` (user-mode) to `2` (PrivUser^[In the paper, the name PrivUser means two things, the execution mode and the secret memory area.]) by using x86 call gates. Note that this solution **mitigates** vulnerabilities like HeartBleed but doesn't **prevent** them necessarily.

To implement this architecture, two requirements must be satisfied. The first requirement is called `M-SR1` in the paper and it states that the PrivUser area should be protected from the normal user mode which most of the application's code runs in. The second requirement is called `M-SR2` in the paper and it states that the kernel should be protected from PrivUser code.

To satisfy the first requirement, the pages of PrivUser are marked as privileged pages in their page entry ^[We have discussed this page entry bit in chapter \ref{ch-process-management}.], that is, the code that run in privilege level `3` cannot access them while the code that runs in levels `0`, `1` and `2` can. To satisfy the second requirement, the authors propose to use segmentation. The `LDT` table is employed to divide each process into segments and a special segment for the secret functions and data, that is, PrivUser is defined. The definition of this segment makes sure that the secret functions can only access the secret data under privilege level `2` in order to protect the kernel's data which resides in privilege level `0`.

This was the high-level description of the LOTRx86 solution, there are some challenges that have been faced by the authors. All of the details on the challenges and how they overcame them can be found in the paper, so, if you are interested on implementing LOTRx86 in your kernel, I encourage you to read the original paper which also discusses how the authors managed to implement their solution in the Linux kernel as kernel modules. The paper also shows the performance evaluation of their implementation. There is something to note, the authors assume that the solution is implemented in the `64-bit` environment instead of `32-bit` and due to that they faced some challenges that may not be faced in the `32-bit` environment.

Of course LOTRx86 is not the only proposed solution for this problem, there are a few more and some of them are mentioned in the same paper that we're discussing. What makes LOTRx86 stand out from the rest is the focus on a solution that has better performance and portability as we've examined in the beginning of this subsection.

As you saw in this solution, the authors played the role of a kernelist, they proposed a solution for a real-world problem, they used some hardware features that are usually used in a different way in the traditional operating systems (privilege level `2` and segmentation) and they proposed a novel and useful idea for operating system kernels.

### Endokernel
The proposed solution in the LOTRx86 paper isolates the memory within a process but what about the other system resources (e.g. files)? For example, what if a critical module in a process needs to read and write a secret file while the other modules of the same process shouldn't be able to reach this file at all. The only system resource that LOTRx86 protects is the memory while the other system resources are accessible by any module within the process.

The paper "The Endokernel: Fast, Secure, and Programmable Subprocess Virtualization" ^[Authored by: Bumjin Im, Fangfei Yang, Chia-Che Tsai, Michael LeMay, Anjo Vahldiek-Oberwagner and Nathan Dautenhahn. Published in 2021.] proposes a solution to handle this issue by modifying the traditional process model which is used by most modern operating systems. In the Endokernel Architecture a monitor is attached within each process. This monitor, which is called the *endokernel*, isolates itself from the untrusted parts of the process and also provides a lightweight virtual machine, called the *endoprocess*, to the rest of the process and enforces isolation through a predefined policy. For example, some processor instructions can be permitted to be executed by the untrusted parts of the process without monitoring but some other can be defined to be monitored. Also, the allowed filesystem operations can be specified by the policy. The endokernel is then going to ensure that this policy is enforced.

## Nested Kernel
In the monolithic kernel design, the kernel is considered as a one single entity and each component of a kernel is able to read/modify the data and maybe even the code of another component since the whole code of the kernel runs in kernel mode. Besides the standard components of the kernel (e.g. process management and memory management), usually, the device drivers are considered to be a part of the monolithic kernel which means they run in kernel mode. These device drivers are, most probably, written by a third party entity, because of this the code written by them must be considered as untrusted code. Also, they may contain bugs and the overall quality may be sub-par compared to the core kernel code. Any exploitable bug in any part of a monolithic kernel (either in a device driver or not) will give an attacker access to the whole kernel. This problem may remind us of the other problem that was presented earlier in this chapter but this time the kernel is the problematic part.

Microkernel design solves this problem by separating most components from the kernel as user-space servers, but what if we'd like to keep the monolithic design and have this kind of separation? This is what a paper titled "Nested Kernel: An Operating System Architecture for Intra-Kernel Privilege Separation" ^[Authored by Nathan Dautenhahn, Theodoros Kasampalis, Will Dietz, John Criswell and Vikram Adve. Published in 2015.] is trying to solve by proposing a new kernel design called the *nested kernel*.

Memory is the root of all evil, that's what I feel this paper is trying to tell us. In the nested kernel design, the operating system kernel is divided into two parts, the first one is the nested kernel and the second part is *outer kernel*. The nested kernel is isolated from the outer kernel and both parts run in kernel mode. The job of the nested kernel is to isolate the memory management unit (MMU) from the outer kernel. To make the outer kernel able to use the functionality that the MMU provides, the nested kernel exposes and controls an interface to the MMU. This interface is called *virtual MMU* (*vMMU*) in the paper, so, if any part of the outer kernel needs to manipulate the state of the MMU then the vMMU interface can be used. The nested kernel part is small and can be considered to run trusted code while the outer kernel contains all the other code that cannot be considered as trusted (e.g. device drivers), this code may contain vulnerabilities and generally bugs. When we say we want to isolate the MMU we mean that the data structures and registers that compose the state of the MMU are isolated, so, in x86 for example, isolating the MMU means isolating the page directory, the page tables and the control registers that are related to paging.

The memory regions which a kernel implementer would like to protect from being modified by the outer kernel (protected memory) are marked as read-only regions in the nested kernel design and only the nested kernel has the permission to modify them. For example, say that you have decided to protect the memory that contains the code of the kernel which checks if the current user has the permissions to read or modify a specific file. This region can by marked as read-only and can be protected by the nested kernel from being modified by any part of the outer kernel. Now, assume that an attacker found an exploitable security bug in one of the device drivers, and their goal is to modify the code that does the permission checks in order to let them read some critical file, this can't be done since the memory region is protected and read-only, the paper discusses in details how to ensure that the outer kernel doesn't violate the protection of nested kernel in the x86 architecture.

That's not the whole story. Making the nested kernel the only way to modify the protected memory by the outer kernel means that the nested kernel can be a mediator which will be called before any modification is performed. This will let the kernel's implementer be able to define security policies and enforce them while the system is running. For example, the authors propose the *no write policy* which doesn't let the outer kernel write at a specific memory region at all (e.g. like in the example of the permission checking code). Another proposed policy is the *write-once policy* which lets the outer kernel write into a region of memory just once. This policy can be useful with the memory region that contains the `IDT` table for example, so, the attacker won't be able to modify the interrupt service routines after setting them up by the trusted code of outer kernel. More policies are presented in the paper. You can see here how the kernelists proposed a new kernel design other than the popular ones (microkernel and monolithic) in order to solve a specific real-world problem.

## Multikernel
The paper "The Multikernel: A new OS architecture for scalable multicore systems" ^[Authored By: Andrew Baumann, Paul Barham, Pierre-Evariste Dagand, Tim Harris, Rebecca Isaacs, Simon Peter, Timothy Roscoe, Adrian SchÃ¼pbach and Akhilesh Singhania. Published in 2009.] shows a good example of kernelists who get completely rid of the old designs in order to provide a modern one which is more suitable for modern days. In the paper, the authors have observed the new trends in modern hardware, these trends motivated them to propose a new kernel architecture named *multikernel*. One of these observations is the diversity of the new hardware systems. According to the authors, the operating systems running on these new systems need to work with machines that have heterogeneous cores, either in terms of the instruction set architecture or the performance. Another observation is that message passing is now easier to implement in modern hardware and can be used instead of shared memory in order to share information between two processes for example. The idea of a multikernel aims to handle these observations and provide an architecture for a kernel that is suitable for the modern multicore systems.

In the multikernel architecture, a multicore system is handled as a network of cores, as if each core was separate processor, and the communication between the cores is performed through message passing. It's not even necessary that the cores belong to the same machine. When the cores are handled as a network of machines, the algorithms and techniques of distributed systems can be used.

The design of a multikernel depends on three principles. First, all communication between the cores in the kernel should be explicit through message passing and no implicit communication (e.g. through shared memory) is allowed. One of the benefits of this principle is the ability to use well-known networking optimizations in order to make the communication between cores more efficient. Also, making the communication explicit can help with reasoning about the correctness of the kernel's code. The second principle is separating the structure of the operating system as much as possible from the hardware, that is, the structure should be hardware neutral. The benefits of this principle are obvious, one of them makes the adoption of processor specific optimizations easier ^[The paper mentions that applying one processor optimization on Windows 7 caused changes in `6,000` lines of code through `58` files.]. The last principle is to deal with the state of the operating system (e.g. the process table) as replicated instead of shared. This means that when a core needs to deal with a global data structure, a copy of this data structure is sent to this core instead of using just one shared copy by all the cores in the system. Based on these design principles, the authors built an implementation called Barrelfish. According to the authors, this implementation is an example of a multikernel but not the only way to build one. The paper discusses in detail how they designed Barrelfish to realize the multikernel design principles and how they overcame the challenges that they have faced.

## Dynamic Reconfiguration
Changing a specific module while the system is running can be an important aspect in some systems. For most desktop users, when some module of a system is changed, due to a system update for example, it's fine to reboot the system to get the new changes applied. But what about a server that needs to run without interruption with no downtime, rebooting it is often not an option. Current operating systems still require a reboot when an update to specific parts is performed, for example, updating the Linux kernel in a running system requires a reboot of this system to be able to use the new version of the kernel ^[Linux allows, to some extent, to update some kernel modules during run-time with a system called *livepatch*, described here: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/livepatch/livepatch.rst].

Dynamic reconfiguration is the process of changing a specific module of the system while keeping it running without the need of rebooting it, that's how a paper titled "Building reconfigurable component-based OS with THINK" ^[Authored by: Juraj Polakovic, Ali Erdem Ã–zcan and Jean-Bernard Stefani. Published in 2006.] defines this term. According to the paper, dynamic reconfiguration consists of the followings steps: First, the part that we would like to reconfigure (the reconfiguration target) should be identified and separated from other parts, to do that, the THINK framework uses a component model called Fractal ^[<https://fractal.ow2.io/>] in order to identify each part of the system as a separate component, after that, the process of reconfiguration is going to deal with these components. For example, in the 539kernel the process management part, the scheduler, the memory management part, the allocator and the filesystem can be defined as separated components. As you can see each of these parts has its own functionality and can be encapsulated, by using dynamic reconfiguration we can for example change the current scheduler with another one while the system is running.

The second step is to make sure that the reconfiguration target is in a safe state, that is, there is no other part that is using the target. Thread counting is one technique that has been proposed in the paper to detect a safe state. When employing this technique any call to a component causes the thread counter to increase by `1` and when this call finishes the thread counter decreases by `1`. A component is in a safe state when the thread counter reaches `0`, that is, no thread (or process) is currently using the target component. After the target component reaches a safe state it can be exchanged to the new component, the context of the target should be moved to the new component and after that the execution of the component can be resumed.

## Unikernel
Virtualization is widely used today and cloud computing is an obvious example of employing virtualization technologies. Nowadays, you can easily start and stop virtual machines that run a commodity operating system (e.g. Linux or Windows) and via this virtual machine you can run whatever software you wish as if this virtual machine is a real one. There are many cases where a virtual machine is used to provide just one thing, for example, a virtual machine that runs a web server solely. To do that, of course an operating system is needed to be installed in the virtual machine, say for example Linux, and of course a web server should be installed on top this operating system, say Apache. Linux (and other modern general purpose operating systems) is a multiprocess and multiuser kernel which contains a lot of code that handles the protections between the processes, the users and the kernel itself (via the separation of kernel-mode and user-mode code as we have discussed through this book). Besides that, there are lots of services that are provided by general purpose operating systems for them to be suitable for all users.

In our example of the virtual machine which only runs a web server, all of these services aren't needed, they can be omitted and only the services that are needed by the web server are kept, this is what *unikernels* do. In this model of kernel design, everything that's not needed is omitted, even the separation between the kernel and the user-space application (in our example the web server) and both of them are executed in a single address space. All of these changes in the kernel architecture provide us with many benefits: the size of the kernel and the final binary will be smaller, it will have better performance ^[On the website of a unikernel called Unikraft the following is stated: "On Unikraft, NGINX is 166% faster than on Linux and 182% faster than on Docker".], it will boot faster and the attack surface will be smaller.

I think a unikernel is a good path to start your journey as a kernelist, especially given this topic is gaining a momentum these days. The idea behind a unikernel is simple: a skeleton of an operating system's kernel which targets a specific architecture (e.g. x86) is provided to the user with specific services (e.g. functions and so on) to make it easy for the user to write their own applications. At this stage, the combination of the kernel and those provided services is known as a *library operating system*. After writing the application, say a web server, both the application and the kernel are built together as one entity which is the unikernel that is going to run on a virtual machine and provide a specific service.

There are many library operating systems available, for example: IncludeOS ^[<https://www.includeos.org/>] whose design is presented in a paper titled "IncludeOS: A minimal, resource efficient unikernel for cloud services" ^[Authored by Alfred Bratterud, Alf-Andre Walla, Harek Haugerud, Paal E. Engelstad and Kyrre Begnum. Published in 2015.], Unikraft ^[<https://unikraft.org/>] whose design is presented in a paper titled "Unikraft: Fast, Specialized Unikernels the Easy Way" ^[Authored by Simon Kuenzer, Vlad-Andrei BÄƒdoiu, Hugo Lefeuvre, Sharan Santhanam, Alexander Jung, Gaulthier Gain, Cyril Soldani, Costin Lupu, Stefan Teodorescu, Costi RÄƒducanu, Cristian Banu, Laurent Mathy, RÄƒzvan Deaconescu, Costin Raiciu and Felipe Huici. Published in 2021.], OSv ^[<https://osv.io/>] and MirageOS ^[<https://mirage.io/>]. Also, there are many new scientific papers that try to find solutions for unikernel problems and advance the area. For example, the paper "Towards a Practical Ecosystem of Specialized OS Kernels" ^[Authored by Conghao Liu and Kyle C. Hale. Published in 2019.] proposes a way to build an ecosystem for library operating systems which helps the user to find a kernel that fits their needs and helps in building the resulting user application. Another paper is titled "A Binary-Compatible Unikernel" ^[Authored by Pierre Olivier, Daniel Chiba, Stefan Lankes, Changwoo Min and Binoy Ravindran. Published in 2019.] which proposes a unikernel named HermiTux ^[<https://ssrg-vt.github.io/hermitux/>] that provides binary compatibility for Linux applications, that is, instead of writing a wholly new application to be used as a unikernel, with binary compatibility one of the mature applications that already exist for Linux can be used instead. For example, running the Apache web server as a unikernel instead of writing a completely new web server is most probably a good idea.

Of course, there are a lot more papers either about unikernels or about any other operating system topic, just search for them and you will find many. I hope you'll begin a happy kernelist/traditionalist journey and thanks for reading this book!
