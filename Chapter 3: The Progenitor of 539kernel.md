# Chapter 3: The Progenitor of the 539kernel {#ch-progenitor}

## Introduction
Up to this point, we have created a bootloader for the 539kernel that loads a simple kernel written in assembly from the disk and transfers control to it. Furthermore, we have gained enough knowledge of the x86 architecture's basics to write the progenitor of the 539kernel which is, as we have said, a `32-bit` x86 kernel that runs in protected mode. In x86, to be able to switch from real mode to protected mode, the global descriptor table (`GDT`) should be initialized and loaded first. After entering the protected mode, the processor will be able to run `32-bit` code which gives us the chance to write the rest of kernel's code in C and use a well-known C compiler (we are going to use GNU GCC in this book) to compile the kernel's code to a `32-bit` binary file. When our code runs in protected mode, the ability to reach BIOS services will be lost which means that printing text on the screen by using a BIOS service will not be available for us. Although the part of printing to the screen is not an essential part of a kernel, we still need it to check if the C code is really running and the easiest way to do this is by printing some text once the C code gains control of the system. Instead of using the BIOS to print text, we need to use the *video memory* to achieve this goal in protected mode which introduces us to a graphics standard known as the *video graphics array* (VGA).

The final result of this chapter will be the progenitor of the 539kernel which has a bootloader that loads the kernel. The kernel consists of two parts: the first part is called a *starter*, it is written in assembly and will be implemented in the file called `starter.asm`. This part initializes and loads the `GDT` table and then changes the operating mode of the processor from real mode to protected mode and finally it prepares the environment the code of the kernel written in C. The part written in C is the second part (we are going to call this part the *main kernel code* or *main kernel* in short), it will be implemented in the file called `main.c`. This part is going to gain control from the starter after the latter finishes its work. In this early stage, the C code will only contain an implementation for the `print` function and it is going to print some text on the screen. In later stages, this part will contain the main code of the 539kernel.

## The Basic Code of The Progenitor
In this section we are going to start writing most of the 539kernel's progenitor code apart from one part which is related to interrupt handling which will be examined in another section in this chapter. To be able to compile and run the code that we write in this section you need to update the `Makefile` of the 539kernel. The changes to the `Makefile` will also be examined in another section in this chapter. The following snippet shows the `Makefile` which assumes that both, `starter.asm` and `main.c`, are available:

```{.makefile}
ASM = nasm
CC = gcc
BOOTSTRAP_FILE = bootstrap.asm
INIT_KERNEL_FILES = starter.asm
KERNEL_FILES = main.c
KERNEL_FLAGS = -Wall -m32 -c -ffreestanding -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables -fno-pie -fno-stack-protector
KERNEL_OBJECT = -o kernel.elf

build: $(BOOTSTRAP_FILE) $(INIT_KERNEL_FILES) $(KERNEL_FILES)
	$(ASM) -f bin $(BOOTSTRAP_FILE) -o bootstrap.o
	$(ASM) -f elf32 $(INIT_KERNEL_FILES) -o starter.o
	$(CC) $(KERNEL_FLAGS) $(KERNEL_FILES) $(KERNEL_OBJECT)
	ld -melf_i386 -Tlinker.ld starter.o kernel.elf -o 539kernel.elf
	objcopy -O binary 539kernel.elf 539kernel.bin
	dd if=bootstrap.o of=kernel.img
	dd seek=1 conv=sync if=539kernel.bin of=kernel.img bs=512 count=5
	dd seek=6 conv=sync if=/dev/zero of=kernel.img bs=512 count=2046
	qemu-system-x86_64 -s kernel.img
```

As you can see, the linker `ld` is now used to link together the object files which have been generated by the compiler and the assembler. The linker needs a script which tells it how to organize the contents of the binary file `539kernel.elf` that will be generated by the linker. The name of the file should be `linker.ld` as it's passed to the linker one of the arguments. The following snippet shows the contents of this file ^[The script is based on the one which is provided by the "JamesM's kernel development tutorials" (<http://www.jamesmolloy.co.uk/tutorial_html/1.-Environment%20setup.html>)]:

```

    bss = .; _bss = .; __bss = .;

  }

  end = .; _end = .; __end = .;
}
```

The bootloader should also be modified to make the progenitor code work. In the previous version of the bootloader, we were loading only one sector from the disk (remember, the size of a sector is `512` bytes) to memory, and that was more than enough for the simple in `simple_kernel.asm` of the chapter \ref{ch-bootloader}. In most practical cases, the size of the kernel will be more than one sector and the 539kernel's progenitor is not an exception. Therefore, the bootloader should load more than one sector in order to load the whole code of the kernel. First we need to add two new data labels in the bootloader. The definitions from the following snippet should be added below the definition of the label `load_error_string`:

```{.asm}
number_of_sectors_to_load   db  15d
curr_sector_to_load         db  2d
```

The first one, as it's name suggests, indicates the number of sectors that we would like our bootloader to load from the disk. The assigned value is `15d`, which means that `7.5KB` from the disk will be loaded to the memory. If the kernel's binary size becomes larger than `7.5KB`, we can simply modify the value of this label to increase the number of sectors to load.

The second label indicates the number of the sector that is being loaded currently. The location specified by this label will be used as the initial value to start loading the kernel and will be increased to indicate the next location to load after the previous one was loaded. As you know, the sector `1` on the disk contains the bootloader (when sector numbering starts from `1`). Based on our arrangement in the `Makefile` of the 539kernel, the code of the kernel starts from sector `2` of the disk. Therefore, the initial value of the label `curr_sector_to_load` is `2`. The modified version of `load_kernel_from_disk` which loads more than one sector is shown in the following snippet:

```{.asm}
load_kernel_from_disk:
	mov ax, [curr_sector_to_load]
	sub ax, 2
	mov bx, 512d
	mul bx
	mov bx, ax
	
	mov ax, 0900h
	mov es, ax
	
	mov ah, 02h
	mov al, 1h
	mov ch, 0h
	mov cl, [curr_sector_to_load]
	mov dh, 0h
	mov dl, 80h
	int 13h
	
	jc kernel_load_error
	
	sub byte [number_of_sectors_to_load], 1
	add byte [curr_sector_to_load], 1
	cmp byte [number_of_sectors_to_load], 0
	
	jne load_kernel_from_disk
	
	ret
```

The first difference in this new version of `load_kernel_from_disk` are the first `5` lines of this routine. As you may recall, the BIOS service `13h:02h` loads the required sector into the memory address `ES:BX`, so, the value `0900h` which has been loaded into `ES` in the code above will be the starting memory address of the kernel. In the previous version of the bootloader it was enough the set `BX` to `0`. Since we were loading only one sector, the code would reside from offset `0` to offset `511` of the segment. Now we are loading more than one sector by executing `load_kernel_from_disk` multiple times (`number_of_sectors_to_load` times) with different `curr_sector_to_load` each time. So, if we would keep the value of `BX` fixed to `0`, each loaded sector would overwrite the previously loaded sector and only the last sector of the kernel would remain in memory, which is, of course, not what we want. The first five lines of `load_kernel_from_disk` ensure that each sector is loaded at the correct memory location. The first sector is loaded starting from the offset `0` (`(2 - 2) * 512 = 0`), the second sector is loaded starting from the offset `512` (`(3 - 2) * 512 = 512`) and the third sector is loaded starting from the offset `1024` (`(4 - 2) * 512 = 1024`).

The second change of the routine is the value that we load into the register `CL`. For the BIOS service `13h:02h`, the value of this register is the sector number that we would like to load the data from. In the new version, this value depends on `curr_sector_to_load` which starts with `2` and increases by `1` after each successful sector load. The last `4` lines before the instruction `ret` ensure that the value of `curr_sector_to_load` is being increased to load the next sector from disk in the next iteration of the routine. The value of `number_of_sectors_to_load` is decreased by `1` after loading each sector and finally the new value of `number_of_sectors_to_load` is compared with `0`. If it is the case then the routine `load_kernel_from_disk` will return, otherwise, the routine will be called again with the new values for both `curr_sector_to_load` and `number_of_sectors_to_load` to load a new sector and so on.

### Writing the Starter
The starter is the first part of the 539kernel that runs right after the bootloader which means that the starter runs in `16-bit` real mode environment, exactly the same as the bootloader. Due to that we are going to write the starter by using the assembly language instead of C. That's because most modern C compilers don't have support for `16-bit` code. Furthermore, when a specific low-level instruction is needed (e.g. `lgdt`), there is no way to call this instruction in native C, instead, the assembly language should be used.

The main job of the starter is to prepare the proper environment for the main kernel to run in. To do that the starter switches the current operating mode from the real mode to protected mode which, as we have said earlier, gives us the chance to run `32-bit` code. Before switching to protected mode, the starter needs to initialize and load the `GDT` table and set up the interrupts. Furthermore, to be able to use the video memory correctly in protected mode a proper video mode should be set. We are going to discuss the matter of video in more details later in this chapter. After finishing these tasks, the starter will be able to switch to protected mode and pass control to the main kernel. Let's start with the prologue of the starter's code which reflects the steps that we have just described:

```{.asm}
bits 16
extern kernel_main

start:
	mov ax, cs
	mov ds, ax
	
	call load_gdt
	call init_video_mode
	call enter_protected_mode
	call setup_interrupts
	
	call 08h:start_kernel
```

The code of the starter begins from the label `start`, from now on we're going to use the term *routine* for any callable assembly label ^[The term routine is more general than the terms function or procedure. If you haven't encountered programming languages that make distinctions between the two terms (e.g. Pascal) then you can consider the term *routine* as a synonym of the term *function* in our discussion.]. By now, you should be familiar with most of this code. As you can see, the routine `start` begins by setting the proper memory address of the data segment depending on the value of the code segment register `CS` ^[As you know from our previous discussion, the value of `CS` will be changed by the processor once a far jump is performed.] which is going to be same as the beginning of the starter's code. After that, the four steps that we have described are divided into four routines that we are going to write during this chapter, these routines are going to be called sequentially. Finally, the starter preforms a far jump to the code of the main kernel. But before examining the details of those steps let's stop at the first two lines of this code which could be new to you:

```{.asm}
bits 16
extern kernel_main
```

The first line uses the directive `bits` which tells `NASM` that the code that follows this line is `16-bit` code. Remember, we are in a `16-bit` real mode environment, so our code should be `16-bit` code. You may wonder, why didn't we use this directive in the bootloader's code? The main reason for that is how `NASM` works. wWhen you tell `NASM` to generate the output in a flat binary format ^[That's exactly what we have done with the bootloader, refer back to chapter \ref{ch-bootloader} and you can see that we have passed the argument `-f bin` to `NASM`.], it is going to interpret the code as `16-bit` code by default unless you use the `bits` directive to tell `NASM` otherwise, for example by using `bits 32` for `32-bit` code or `bits 64` for `64-bit` code. But in the case of the starter, it is required from `NASM` to assemble it as an `ELF32` instead of a flat binary, therefore, the `16-bit` code must be marked for `NASM` to assemble it as `16-bit` code and not as `32-bit` code which is the default for `ELF32`.

The second line uses the directive `extern` which tells `NASM` that there is a symbol ^[A symbol is a term that means a function name or a variable name.] which is external and not defined in any place in the current code (for example, as a label) that is being assembled. So, whenever `NASM` encounters this symbol in the current assembly unit, `NASM` won't panic, and continue it's job, knowing that the address of this symbol will be figured out later by the linker. In our situation, the symbol `kernel_main` is the name of a function that will be defined as C code in the main kernel code, it will be the entry point of the main kernel.

As we've said earlier, the details that are related to interrupts will be examined in another section in this chapter. To get a working progenitor we are going to define the routine `setup_interrupts` as an empty routine temporarily until we reach the interrupts section. Its code will be the following:

```{.asm}
setup_interrupts:
	ret
```

#### Entering Protected Mode
The code of `load_gdt` routine is the following:

```{.asm}
load_gdt:
	cli
	lgdt [gdtr - start]
	
	ret
```

According to Intel's x86 manual, it is recommended to disable the interrupts before starting the process of switching to protected mode, so, the first step of the `load_gdt` routine is to disable the interrupts by using the instruction `cli` ^[In fact, `cli` disables only maskable interrupts, as mentioned before, but we use the general term interrupts here for the sake of simplicity.].

The second step of `load_gdt` is setting the value of `GDTR` register. In the operand of `lgdt` in this line you can see two symbols, `gdtr` and `start`. Both of these symbols are labels in the starter code. We have already defined `start` as a label for the main routine of the starter, but the label `gdtr` is one that we are going to define later. What you need to know right now about this label is that it contains the value that we would like to load into the register `GDTR`, that is, it contains the memory address of the 539kernel's `GDT` table and the size of the table.

From our previous discussions, you know that when we mention any label in the assembly code, `NASM` will substitute it by the memory address of this label, so, what is going on with the operand `[gdtr - start]` of `lgdt`? And why do we need to subtract the memory address of the label `start` from the memory address of the label `gdtr`?

First we need to understand the meaning of the brackets `[]` in `NASM`. Those brackets are used to refer to the contents of a memory address inside the brackets. For example, assume we have a label named `foo` and we store the value `bar` in this label, in the same way the labels `title_string` and `message_string` in the bootloader store the according strings. Then, `[foo]` in `NASM` means to take the memory address of `foo` and then get the contents of the memory inside this memory location, namely the value `bar`. In other words, `mov eax, foo` means to put the memory address of the label `foo` inside the register `eax` while `mov eax, [foo]` means to put the value `bar` inside the register. This concept very similar to pointers in C. Imagine `foo` is a pointer, then the expression `*foo` is the same as `mov eax, [foo]` while the expression `foo` is the same as `mov eax, foo`.

After this explanation we should now understand that `[gdtr - start]` means subtract the memory address of `start` from the memory address of `gdtr` and use the result as a memory address and take the contents inside it and load these contents into the register `GDTR`. But the question remains, why do we need to perform the subtraction? Isn't it enough to just get the memory address of the label `gdtr` and get its contents and load them into `GDTR`?

The problem is when we refer to any label, this label will be substituted with the **full memory address** of that label, and if we tell `NASM` to get the contents of the label `gdtr` via the dereference `[gdtr]` a reference to the memory will be issued. As we've said earlier, with any reference to the memory, the processor, in real mode, is going to consult the corresponding segment register, in our case `DS`, and interpret the referred memory address as an offset inside the segment which is defined by the segment register instead of interpreting it as a full memory address. So, when we refer to the location of the label `gdtr` we need to make sure that we are referring to the **offset** of `gdtr` inside our current data segment and not the full memory address, otherwise, the referred address will not be correct.

To get the offset of `gdtr` instead of its full memory address we simply subtract the start memory address of the data segment from the memory address of `gdtr`. We can get the value of that memory address in many ways, one of them is by referring to the `start` label since both `CS` and `DS` start at the same place.

Let's look at an example to make the matter of getting the offset of a label clearer. Assume that the memory address of `start` is `1000d` while the memory address of `gdtr` is `1050d`. Based on the code at the beginning of the `start` routine, the value of `DS` will be also `1000d`, then `gdtr - start = 1050d - 1000d = 50d`. When the processor refers to the memory location by using the starting address of the data segment which is in `DS` the final generated address will be `ds:(gdtr - start) = 1000d:50d = 1050d` which is exactly the same as the memory address of `gdtr`.

Now, let's take a look at the value of the label `gdtr`. For the sake of code organization, we've dedicated a separate file for the values of `gdtr` and `gdt` named `gdt.asm`. To make the starter able to reach the labels `gdtr` and `gdt` which reside in a different assembly file than `starter.asm` we can use `NASM`'s directive `%include` which will be substituted with the contents of the file which is passed to this directive. So, at the end of `starter.asm` we need to add the line `%include "gdt.asm"` so the starter can reach `gdtr`. Now let's look at the contents of `gdt.asm`:

```{.asm}
gdt:
	null_descriptor				:	dw 0, 0, 0, 0
	kernel_code_descriptor		:	dw 0xffff, 0x0000, 0x9a00, 0x00cf
	kernel_data_descriptor		:	dw 0xffff, 0x0000, 0x9200, 0x00cf
	userspace_code_descriptor	:	dw 0xffff, 0x0000, 0xfa00, 0x00cf
	userspace_data_descriptor	:	dw 0xffff, 0x0000, 0xf200, 0x00cf

gdtr:
	gdt_size_in_bytes	:	dw ( 5 * 8 )
	gdt_base_address	:	dd gdt

```
The label `gdt` is the `GDT` table of the 539kernel, while the label `gdtr` is the content of the special register `GDTR` that should be loaded by the starter to make the processor use the 539kernel's `GDT`. The structures of both the `GDT` table and the `GDTR` register have been examined in detail in the previous chapter \ref{ch-x86}.

As you can see, the `GDT` table of the 539kernel contains `5` entries ^[The values of the descriptors here are used from the Basekernel project (<https://github.com/dthain/basekernel>).]. The first one is known as the *null descriptor* which is a requisite in the x86 architecture. In every `GDT` table, the first entry should be the null entry that contains zeros. The second and third entries represent the code segment and the data segment of the kernel, while the fourth and the fifth entries represent the code segment and the data segment of the user-space applications. The properties of each entry are shown in the following table and as you can see, based on the base address, the limit and the granularity of each segment, the 539kernel employs the flat memory model:

| Descriptor's Name | Offset in GDT | Base | Limit   | Granularity |

Because the values of the `GDT` entries are set on the bit level, we need to combine these bits as bytes or a larger unit than a byte like in our current code. By combining the bits into larger units, the final result will be unreadable for a human. As you can see, a mere look at the values of each entry in the code above cannot tell us directly what are the properties of each of these entries. Due to that we've written a simple Python `3` script that generates the proper values as double words by taking the required entries in `GDT` and their properties as `JSON` input. The following snippet shows the code of the script that lets you generate a different `GDT` table than the one which is presented here:

```{.python}
import json;

def generateGDTAsWords( gdtAsJSON, nasmFormat = False ):
	gdt = json.loads( gdtAsJSON );
	gdtAsWords = '';
	
	for entry in gdt:

			gdtAsWords += entry[ 'name' ] + ': dw ';
				
		if entry[ 'type' ] == 'null':
			gdtAsWords += '0, 0, 0, 0\n';

			baseAddress = int( entry[ 'base_address' ], 16 );
			limit = int( entry[ 'limit' ], 16 );
			
			baseAddressParts = [ baseAddress & 0xffff, ( baseAddress >> 16 ) & 0xff, ( baseAddress >> 24 ) & 0xff ]
			limitParts = [ limit & 0xffff, ( limit >> 16 ) & 0xf ];

			words = list( map( lambda word: '0x' + format( word, 'x' ).zfill( 4 ), words ) );
			
			gdtAsWords += words[ 0 ] + ', ' + words[ 1 ] + ', ' + words[ 2 ] + ', ' + words[ 3 ] + '\n';
		else:
			raise Exception( 'Unkown Segment Type: ' + str( entry ) );
	
	return gdtAsWords;
```

As you can see, the function `generateGDTAsWords` takes two parameters and returns a `GDT` table as words where each entry is presented on a new line. The first parameter is the `GDT` table in `JSON` format. When `True` is passed to the second parameter, the result will be generated as `NASM` lines, that is, a label will be added before each entry and the pseudoinstruction `dw` is used. The following is an example of calling `generateGDTAsWords` to generate a `GDT` table exactly like the one of the 539kernel:

```{.python}
gdt = '''
[
	{ 	"name": "null_descriptor", "type": "null" },
	
	{ 	"name": "kernel_code", "base_address": "0", 
		"limit": "fffff", "granularity": "4kb", 
		"system_segment": false, "type": "code", 
		"accessed": false, "read_enabled": true, "conforming": false,
		"privilege_level": 0, "present": true, "operation_size": "32bit", "64bit": false  },
		
	{ 	"name": "kernel_data", "base_address": "0",

	{ 	"name": "userspace_code", "base_address": "0",

	{ 	"name": "userspace_data", "base_address": "0", 
		"limit": "fffff", "granularity": "4kb", 
		"system_segment": false, "type": "data",

		"privilege_level": 3, "present": true, "upper_bound": "4gb", "64bit": false  }
]
''';

print( generateGDTAsWords( gdt, True ) );
```

Let's get back to our assembly code. The second label `gdtr` has the same structure as the x86 register `GDTR` since we want to load the contents of this label to the register directly as is. As you can see, the first part of `gdtr` is the size of the `GDT` table, we know that we have `5` entries in our `GDT` table and we already know from the previous chapter \ref{ch-x86} that each entry in the `GDT` table has the size of `8` bytes, that means the total size of our `GDT` table is `5 * 8 = 40 bytes`. The second part of `gdtr` is the full memory address of the label `gdt`. As you can see here, we didn't subtract the memory address of `start` from the memory address of `gdt`. That's because we need to load the full physical memory address of `gdt` into the `GDTR` register and not just its offset inside a given data segment. As we know, when the processor tries to reach the `GDT` table it doesn't consult any segment register ^[It is would be paradoxical, otherwise! To reach the `GDT` table you would need to reach the `GDT` table first!], it assumes that the full physical memory address of the `GDT` is stored in the register `GDTR`. To get the full memory address of a label in `NASM` we need to just use the name of that label.

Let's now examine the routine `enter_protected_mode` which does the real job of switching the operating mode of the processor from real mode to protected mode:

```{.asm}
enter_protected_mode:
	mov eax, cr0
	or eax, 1
	mov cr0, eax
	
	ret
```

To understand what this code does we need first to know what is a *control register*. In x86 there are several control registers, and one of them has the name `CR0` and the others are called `CR1` to `CR7`. The control registers contain values that determine the behavior of the processor. For example, the last bit of `CR0`, that is, bit `31` indicates that paging is currently enabled when its value is `1`, while the value `0` means paging is disabled. The bit that is currently of interest is the first bit (bit `0`) in `CR0`. When the value of this bit is `1` it means protected mode is enabled, while the value `0` means protected mode is disabled.

To switch the operating mode to protected mode we need to change the value of this bit to `1` and that's exactly what we do in the routine `enter_protected_mode`. Because we can't manipulate the value of a control register directly, we copy the value of `CR0` to `EAX` in the first line. Note that we are using `EAX` here instead of `AX` and that's because the size of `CR0` is `32-bit`. We need to keep all values of other bits in `CR0` unchanged but the value of bit `0` should be changed to `1`. To perform this we use the boolean operator instruction `or` that works on the bit level. We do this bitwise operation, that is, an operation on the bit level, on the second line of the routine `enter_protected_mode`. The value of `EAX`, which at this point is the same as the value in `CR0`, will be *ORred* with the value `1`. The binary representation of the operand `1` for this instruction will be the following: `0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001`, it's a binary sequence that has the length of `32-bit`s with `31` leading zeros and the number `1` as the `32`nd bit (the least significant bit).

Now, what does the boolean operator `OR` do? It takes two parameters and each parameter has two possible values, `0` or `1` ^[In boolean logic, the number `1` can be interpreted as the value **true** and the number `0` as the value **false**.]. There are only four possible combinations of inputs in this case, as shown in the following truth table:

| Input 1 | Input 2 | Output |
|---------|---------|--------|
| 0       | 0       | 0      |
| 1       | 0       | 1      |
| 0       | 1       | 1      |
| 1       | 1       | 1      |

This table shows that if one of the inputs is `1` then the output should be `1`. Also, we can notice that when one of the inputs is `0` then the output will always be same as the other input ^[Boolean operators are well-known in programming languages and they are used mainly with the `if` statement.]. By employing these two observations we can keep all values from bit `1` to bit `31` of `CR0` by `OR`ring their values with `0` and we can change the value of the bit `0` to `1` by `OR`ring its current value with `1`. Consider the following example of a value of the `CR0` register and the result of `OR`ing it with the value `1`:

```
Value of CR0:    1110 0100 1000 0000 0000 0011 0111 0000
                 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001
Result after OR: 1110 0100 1000 0000 0000 0011 0111 0001
```

You can see that after applying the `OR` operation with the value of the `CR0` register and the value `1`, the only bit that changes is the `32`nd bit, all the other bits are left unchanged. That's exactly what we do in the second line of the routine. As we've said, the operation that we have just explained is known as a *bitwise operation*. Finally, we move the new value to `CR0` in the last line, and after executing this line the operating mode of the processor will be changed to protected mode.

#### Setting the Video Mode
As we've mentioned before, the BIOS services aren't available in protected mode. Hence, when we need to print some text on the screen after switching to protected mode we can't use the same way that we have used up to this point. Instead, the video memory which is a part of the VGA hardware should be used to write text or to draw something on the screen.

To be able to use the video memory a correct *video mode* should be set and there is a BIOS service that we can use to do that. That means, before switching to protected mode the correct video mode should be set first. We need to use a BIOS service to do this and that's why the routine `init_video_mode` is called before the routine `enter_protected_mode`. Now let's take a look at the code of `init_video_mode`:

```{.asm}
init_video_mode:
	mov ah, 0h
	mov al, 03h
	int 10h
	
	mov ah, 01h
	mov cx, 2000h
	int 10h
	
	ret
```

This routine consists of two parts, the first part calls the BIOS service `10h:0h`. This service sets the video mode, the mode number is passed via the register `AL`. As you can see here, we are requesting from the BIOS to set the video mode to `03h` which is a *text mode* with `16` colors. Another example of a video mode is `13h` which is a *graphics mode* with `256` colors. This means, that when using this video mode, we can draw whatever we want on the screen. It can be used to implement a graphical user interface (GUI). However, for our current purposes, we are going to set the video mode to `03h` since we just need to print some text.

The second part of this routine uses the BIOS service `10h:01h`. The purpose of this part is to disable the text cursor. Since the user of the 539kernel will not be able to write text as input, like in a command line interface for example, we will not show the cursor. The service `10h:01h` is used to set the type of the cursor, and the value `2000h` that is passed via the register `CX` means that the cursor should be disabled.


#### Passing Control to the Main Kernel Code
According to Intel's manual, after switching to protected mode a far jump should be performed and the protected mode's way of dealing with segments (via segment selectors) should be used. Let's begin with the routine `start_kernel` which is the last routine to be called from the `start` routine, it should be placed at the end of `starter.asm` just before the last line `%include "gdt.asm"`:

```{.asm}
bits 32
start_kernel:
	mov eax, 10h
	mov ds, eax
	mov ss, eax
	
	mov eax, 0h
	mov es, eax
	mov fs, eax
	mov gs, eax
	
	sti
	
	call kernel_main
```

As you can see, the directive `bits` is used here to tell `NASM` that the following code should be assembled as `32-bit` code since this code will run in protected mode and not in real mode. As you can see, the first and second part of this routine loads the correct segment selectors into the segment registers. In the first part, the segment selector `10h` (`16d`) is set as the data segment and stack segment while the other data segment registers will are set to use the segment selector `0h` which points to the null descriptor, that means they won't be used. Finally, the function `kernel_main` is called. This function, as we've mentioned earlier, will be the main C function of the 539kernel.

The far jump which is required after switching to protected mode is already performed by the line `call 08h:start_kernel` in the `start` routine. And you can see that we have used the segment selector `08h` to do that. While it may be obvious why we have selected the value `08h` for the far jump and `10h` as the segment selector for the data segment, a clarification of the reason of choosing these values won't hurt.

To make sense of these two values you need to refer to the table that summarized the `GDT` entries of the 539kernel in this chapter. As you can see from the table, the segment selector ^[We use the relaxed definition of segment selector here that we have defined in the previous chapter \ref{ch-x86}.] of kernel's code segment is `08h`. That means any logical memory address that refers to the kernel's code should refer to the segment selector `08h` which is the index and the offset of kernel's code segment descriptor in the `GDT`. If it's the case, the processor is going to fetch this descriptor from the `GDT` and based on the segment starting memory address and the required offset, the linear memory address will be computed as we have explained previously in chapter \ref{ch-x86}. When we perform the far jump to the kernel's code we use the segment selector `08h` which will be loaded by the processor into the register `CS`. The same happens for the data segment of the kernel. As you can see, its segment selector is `16d` (`10h`) and that's the value that we load into the data segment registers that are relevant to us. As you can see from the code, before jumping to the kernel code, the interrupts are enabled by using the instruction `sti`. As you may recall, we have disabled them when we started to load the `GDT`.

### Writing the C Kernel
Now, we are ready to write the C code of the 539kernel. As mentioned earlier, our first C implementation is going to print some text on the screen after the control of the processor is passed to it from the starter. Before we can write this code, we need to get more acquainted with the VGA standard.

#### A Glance at Graphics with VGA
Video Graphics Array (VGA) is a graphics standard that has been introduced with IBM PS/2 in 1987, and because our modern computers are compatible with the old IBM PC we can still use this standard. VGA is easy to use for our purposes. At any point in time the screen can be in a specific *video mode*. Each video mode has its own properties such as the resolution and the number of available colors.

Basically, we can divide the available video modes into two groups. The first one consists of the modes that support only text output, that is, when the screen is in one of these modes then the only text can be output on the screen. The modes that belong to this group are called *text modes*. The second group consists of the modes that can be used to draw pixels on the screen and we call the modes that belong to this group *graphics modes*. We know that everything on a computer's screen is drawn by using pixels, including texts and even the components of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that are called widgets by many GUI libraries (such as GTK+, for example). Usually, some basic low-level graphics library is used by the GUI toolkits to draw the shapes of these widgets. Such a low-level library provides functions to draw some primitive shapes pixel by pixel. For instance, it can provide a function to draw a line or another function to draw a rectangle and so on. This basic library can be used by the GUI toolkits to draw more advanced shapes. A simple example is the button widget, which is basically drawn on the screen as a rectangle. The GUI toolkit usually maintains some basic properties that are associated with this rectangle to transform a soulless shape on the screen into a button that can be clicked, fires events, and has some label upon it.

Whether the screen is in a text or graphics mode, to print a character on the screen or to draw some pixels on it, the entities (pixels or characters) that you would like to show on the screen should be written to the *video memory* which is just a part of the main memory. The video memory has a known fixed starting memory address. For example, in text mode, the starting memory address of the video memory is `b8000h` ^[Note that the character `b` in this number isn't a new prefix but it's simply the most significant digit of this `h`exadecimal number. This number corresponds the the decimal number `753664d`.] as we will see in a moment. Note that this memory address is a physical memory address, neither logical nor linear. Writing ASCII character codes starting from this memory address is going to cause the screen to display the characters that these ASCII codes represent.

##### VGA Text Mode
When the screen is in the text mode `03h`, a character that we would like to print should be represented (encoded) in two bytes and which should be stored contiguously in video memory. The first byte is the ASCII code of the character, while the second byte contains the information about the background and foreground colors that will be used to print this character. 

Before getting started with the implementation of the 539kernel's `print` function, let's take a simple example of how to print a character, for example the character `A`, on the screen by using the video memory. From starter's code you know that the function `kernel_main` is the entry point of the main kernel code:

```{.c}
volatile unsigned char *video = 0xB8000;

void kernel_main()
{
	video[ 0 ] = 'A';

	while( 1 );
}
```

Ignore for the moment the last line `while ( 1 );`, it is an infinite loop and it is not related to our current discussion. As you can see, we have defined a `char` pointer (`1` byte wide) called `video` which points to the beginning of the video memory in color text mode ^[A monochrome text mode is also available and its video memory starts from `b0000h`.]. Here, due to the C language's feature that considers the array access syntax a syntactic sugar over pointer arithmetic ^[Thanks God!] we can write the ASCII code of `A` to the memory location `b0000h + 0` to make the screen show the character `A`. This happens in the line `video[ 0 ] = 'A'`. Now, let's assume we would like to print `B` right after `A`, then we can add the line `video[ 2 ] = 'B';` to the code. Note that the array index that we write `B` to is `2` and not `1`, why is it the case? Because as we said, the byte right after the character contains the character's color information and not the next character that we would like to print.

For sure, each character that we print has a specific position on the screen. Usually, in computer graphics the Cartesian coordinate system is used to indicate the position of the graphical entity in question (e.g. a pixel, or in our current case a character). The limits (the maximum number on the axis) of the `x` and the `y` axes are determined by the resolution of the screen. For example, in `03h` text mode the resolution of the screen is `80` for the width (the `x` axis) and `25` for the height (the `y` axis). That means that the last available number on the `x` axis is `80` and on the `y` axis it's `25`. Therefore, the last coordinates that we can use to print a character is `(80, 25)` and its position will be on the very bottom right of the screen while the position of the point `(0, 0)` which is also known as the *origin point* is on the very top left of the screen.

In the previous example when we wrote the character `A` at the location `0` of the video memory we actually put it at the origin point, while we have put `B` at the point `(1, 0)`, that is, in the first row and the second column of the screen. As you can see, each even location ^[As you know, the characters are stored in even locations of the video memory, while the color information of those characters is stored in odd locations.] of the video memory has exactly one equivalent point in the coordinate system so a memory location can be translated to a point and a point can be translated to a memory location.

Now, knowing what we know about the text mode, let's write some functions for the 539kernel that deal with printing stuff on the screen. The first function is `print`, which takes a string of characters as a parameter and prints the whole string on the screen. The second function is `println` which prints a new line. Finally, the last function is `printi` which prints integers on the screen.

Let's begin by defining some global variables that we will use later and writing the declarations of the three functions. These declarations should be put on the top of `main.c`, that is, before the code of `kernel_main`, and the code of those functions should be on the bottom of `kernel_main` ^[Can you tell why?]:

```{.c}
volatile unsigned char *video = 0xB8000;

int nextTextPos = 0;
int currLine = 0;

void print( char * );
void println();
void printi( int );
```

The global variable `nextTextPos` is used to maintain the value of `x` in the coordinate system which will be used to print the next character while `currLine` maintains the current value of `y` in the coordinate system, in other words, the current line on the screen that the characters will be printed to. The following snippet shows the code of `print`:

```{.c}
void print( char *str )
{
	int currCharLocationInVidMem, currColorLocationInVidMem;
	
	while ( *str != '\0' )
	{
		currCharLocationInVidMem = nextTextPos * 2;
		currColorLocationInVidMem = currCharLocationInVidMem + 1;
		
		video[ currCharLocationInVidMem ] = *str;
		video[ currColorLocationInVidMem ] = 15;
		
		nextTextPos++;
		
		str++;
	}
}
```

Besides putting the characters in the correct location in the video memory, the function `print` has two other jobs to do. The first one is to iterate through each character in the string that has been passed via the parameter `str` and the second one is to translate the coordinate system value `x` into the corresponding memory location ^[Please note that the way of writing this code and any other code in the 539kernel, as mentioned in the introduction of this book, focuses on simplicity and readability of the code instead of any kind of efficiency. Therefore, there absolutely are better ways to write this code and most other code in terms of performance or space efficiency].

For the first job, we use the normal way of the C programming language which considers strings to be arrays of characters that end with the null character `\0`. For the second job, the two local variables `currCharLocationInVidMem` and `currColorLocationInVidMem` which, as we think, have pretty self-explanatory names, are used to store the calculated video memory location that we are going to put the character in. This calculation uses the value of `nextTextPos`.

Since the characters should be stored in an even position we multiply the current value `nextTextPos` by `2` to get the next even location in the video memory, and since `nextTextPos` starts from `0`, we can ensure that we will use all available locations in the video memory. Because the color information is stored in the byte adjacent to the character byte, it's very easy to calculate `currColorLocationInVidMem`, we just need to add `1` to the location of the character. Finally, we increase the value of `nextTextPos` by `1` because we have used the `x` position that `nextTextPos` is pointing to to print the current character. The last thing to discuss is the code line which writes the color information, `video[ currColorLocationInVidMem ] = 15;`. As you can see, we have used the value `15` which means white color as foreground. You can manipulate this value to change the background and foreground colors of the characters. Next, let's take a look at the code of `println`:

```{.c}
void println()
{
	nextTextPos = ++currLine * 80;
}
```

The implementation of `println` is very simple. The width of the screen in the `03h` text mode is `80` which means `80` characters can be printed on a single line and each line on the screen occupies `160` bytes (`80 * 2`) in video memory. Line `0` which is at the top of the screen is the first line on the screen, in other words, line numbering starts from `0`. To obtain the first `x`-position on any line, the line number must be multiplied by `80`, so, the first position on line `0` is `0 * 80 = 0` and the first position on line `1` (which is the second line) is `1 * 80 = 80`. This means the positions from `0` to `79` belong to the first line and the positions `80` to `159` belong to the second line and so on. The function `println` uses these facts to change the position that is used by `print` when the next character must be printed by updating the current character position (`x`) which is stored in `nextTextPos`. The following snippet shows the code of `printi`:

```{.c}
void printi( int number )
{
	char* digitToStr[] = { "0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9" };
	
	if ( number >= 0 && number <= 9 )
	{
		print( digitToStr[ number ] );
		return;
	}
	else
	{
		int remaining = number % 10;
		number = number / 10;
		
		printi( number );
		printi( remaining );
	}
}
```

Let's assume the value of the parameter `number` is `539`. When we calculate `539` % `10 = 9` ^[The operation which is represented by % is known as modulus, it's result is the remainder of a division.] we get the digit in the most right position of `539`. Also, when we calculate `539 / 10 = 53.9` and then we take only the integer part of this float result we get `53`. By using these simple arithmetic operations, we manage to get the last digit (the least significant digit) from a number and remove this digit from the number. This algorithm splits a number into digits in reverse order. Due to that we use recursion as a simple solution to process the digits of the number in the correct order. As the last step, we want to print the number to the screen character by character, to do this we convert the digit into a character by using the array `digitToStr` and finally we use the function `print` that we defined before to do the actual work of printing the character.

##### VGA Graphics Mode
Although the 539kernel provides a text-based interface, it is useful to take a glance at how the VGA graphics mode works. First, to use the graphics mode instead of the text mode, the value `03h`, which is passed to the register `AL` in the routine `init_video_mode` of the starter, should be changed to `13h` which gives us the graphics mode with `320x200` pixels resolution and `256` colors. Also, the starting memory location of the graphics mode is different from the text mode, it is `a0000h`.

Like in text mode, which we explained in the previous section, we use the coordinate system to specify the position of a graphical entity on the screen. In text mode the graphical entity was a character, while in graphics mode a graphical entity is a pixel which is a small dot on the screen that has a color. This small dot, when combined with many other dots of different colors, creates all the graphics that we can see on computers monitors.

Given that the provided resolution is `320x200` and that the graphical entity is a pixel, we should know that we can fit up to `200` lines (the height or the `y`-axis) on the screen and each line can have up to `320` (the width or the `x`-axis) of our graphical entities/pixels.

The structure of the video memory is even simpler in graphics mode. Each byte represents a pixel at a specific position on the screen. This byte contains a numeric value which represents the color of the pixel to be shown on the screen. By using this simple mechanism combined with some knowledge of the basics of geometry you can draw some primitive shapes on the screen (e.g. lines, rectangles, and circles) and by using these basic shapes you can then draw even more complex shapes. If you are interested in the topic of drawing shapes by using pixels, you should read more about the basics of computer graphics and geometry. We recommend the tutorial named "256-Color VGA Programming in C" by David Brackeen ^[http://www.brackeen.com/vga/index.html] as a good starter that covers the basics of graphics programming. While we are not going to explain this topic any further since it is out of our scope ^[Sorry about that! We actually think that this is a very interesting topic in its own right, but this book is about operating system kernels!] this subsection will be closed with the following example which is intended to give you a feeling of how to draw pixels on the screen. The code is going to draw blue pixels at all available positions on the screen which is going to be perceived as a uniformly blue background:

```{.c}
volatile unsigned char *video = 0xA0000;


void kernel_main()
{
	for ( int currPixelPos = 0; currPixelPos < 320 * 200; currPixelPos++ )
		video[ currPixelPos ] = 9;
	
	while( 1 );
}
```
#### The Code of `kernel_main`
Now, everything is ready for us to write the function `kernel_main`. It does nothing but printing some text by using the functions that we have defined earlier:

```{.c}
void kernel_main()
{
	print( "Welcome to 539kernel!" );
	println();
	print( "We are now in protected mode" );
	println();
	printi( 539 );
	println();
	
	while( 1 );
}
```

## Interrupts in Practice
In the previous chapter \ref{ch-x86} we learned that there can be two sources of interrupts, the first source can be the software, while the second source can be the hardware. A special device which is connected to the processor and is known as the *programmable interrupt controller* (PIC)^[The newer technology is known as the *advanced programmable interrupt controller* (APIC)] is available in the machines to make it possible for the other devices to send hardware interrupts. The job of this device is to send the interrupts of other devices (e.g. the hard disk) to the processor. In other words, the PIC is a mediator between the machine's I/O devices and the processor. When a device needs to interrupt the processor to handle some event (e.g. the disk has finished copying some data to the main memory) it is going to send this interrupt to the PIC which is going to send it to the processor. This type of an interrupt is known as the *interrupt request* (IRQ).

Only `8` devices can be attached to one PIC device. `IRQ0` is the name of the interrupt which is emitted by the device which is attached to the first slot of the PIC, `IRQ1` is the name for the device which is attached to the second slot of the PIC and so on. Because `8` slots are not enough to attach all external devices to the processor, another PIC is attached to the first one. In this arrangement, the first PIC is known as the *master PIC* while the second PIC which is attached to the master is known as the *slave PIC*.

![The Arrangement of Master and Slave PICs](Figures/progenitor-ch/Fig21082021_0.png){#fig:21082021_0 width=50%}

Figure @fig:21082021_0 shows this arrangement. As you can see, with two PICs, there are `15` slots available in the whole system instead of only `8` slots. In the master PIC, the third slot (`IRQ2`) is connected to the slave PIC. This means that all interrupts received by the slave PIC from the attached devices will be sent to the master PIC through the slot `IRQ2`. All other slots in both master (`IRQ0` to `IRQ7` except `IRQ2`) and slave PICs (`IRQ8` to `IRQ15`) are connected to external devices. There is a standard which describes the device types that each `IRQ` is dedicated to. For example, `IRQ0` is the interrupt which is received by a device known as the *system timer*. This device sends an interrupt each unit of time and is extremely useful for multitasking environments as we shall see later when we start discussing process management. The following table shows the use of each `IRQ` ^[Source: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt_request_(PC_architecture)>]:

| IRQ | Description                   |
|-----|-------------------------------|
| 0   | System Timer                  |
| 1   | Keyboard (PS/2 port)          |
| 2   | Slave PIC                     |
| 3   | Serial Port 2 (COM)           |
| 4   | Serial Port 1 (COM)           |
| 5   | Parallel Port 3 or Sound Card |
| 6   | Floppy Disk Controller        |
| 7   | Parallel Port 1               |
| 8   | Real-time Clock               |
| 9   | ACPI                          |
| 10  | Available                     |
| 11  | Available                     |
| 12  | Mouse (PS/2 port)             |
| 13  | Coprocessor                   |
| 14  | Primary ATA                   |
| 15  | Secondary ATA                 |

After receiving an `IRQ` from a device, the PIC should send this request to the processor. At this stage each `IRQ` number is mapped (or translated, if you prefer) to an interrupt number for the processor. For example, `IRQ0` will be sent to the processor as interrupt number `8d`, `IRQ1` will be mapped to interrupt number `9d` and so on until `IRQ7` which will be mapped to interrupt number `15d` (`0Fh`), while `IRQ8` till `IRQ15` will be mapped to interrupt numbers from `112d` (`70h`) to `119d` (`77h`).

In the real mode, this mapping is fine, but in protected mode it is going to cause conflicts between software and hardware interrupts. That is, one interrupt number will be used by both software and hardware interrupts which may cause some difficulties later on when trying to distinguish between the sources of this interrupt, namely whether it was issued by the software or the hardware. For example, in protected mode, interrupt number `8d` which is used for system timer interrupts by the PIC is also used by the processor when a software error known as *double fault* occurs. The good thing is that the PIC is **programmable**, which means that we can send commands to the PIC and tell it to change the default mapping (from `IRQ`s to processor's interrupt numbers) to another mapping of our choice.

There are two well-known ways for the processor to communicate with external devices, we have already encountered one of them when we worked with the video memory which allows the processor to communicate with the screen to write characters or draw pixels. This type of communication between the processor and a device is known as *memory-mapped I/O* communication, that is, the main memory is used to as the communication channel.

There is another communication channel which is used by the PIC and it is known as *port-mapped I/O* communication. With this method, each device (that uses this communication channel) has *ports*, each port has its own unique number and purpose. For example, the master PIC has two ports. The number of the first port is `20h` while the number of the second port is `21h`. The first port is used to send commands ^[Each device has its own set of commands.] to the master PIC while the second port is used to write data so that the master PIC can read it. The same is applicable to the slave PIC with different port numbers, `a0h` and `a1h` respectively. A PIC has no explicit command to remap `IRQ`s, instead, there is a command to initialize a PIC, this initialization consists of multiple steps and one of these steps is to set the desired mapping. Now, we can implement the skeleton of `setup_interrupts` as follows:

```
setup_interrupts:
	call remap_pic
	call load_idt
	
	ret
```

First, we are going to remap `IRQ`s to different interrupt numbers by sending the initialization command to both master and slave PICs. Then we are going to initialize and load the `IDT` and write the necessary interrupt handlers which are also known as *interrupt service routines* (ISRs).

### Remapping PICs
As we have said, we need to change the default mapping between `IRQ`s and the interrupt numbers of the processor to make sure that there can be no more than one source that can emit a signal for one interrupt number. This process is known as *PIC remapping* and it's quite simple to do. As we learned, communication via a PIC is port-mapped I/O, and by using the `out` instruction of x86 we can write data on a given port number.

The *initialization command* of a PIC is represented by the number `11h`, which means writing this value on the command port of a PIC by using the `out` instruction is going to tell the PIC device that we are going to initialize it. When we send this command to the PIC through its associated command port (`20h` for the master PIC and `a0h` for the slave PIC), it is going to wait for us to write four parameters on its data port (`21h` for the master PIC and `a1h` for the slave PIC), the values of these parameters are represented by numbers as we shall see in a moment.

The first parameter that should be provided to the initialization command is the new starting offset for `IRQ`s. For example, if the value of this parameter is `32d` for the master PIC, that means that `IRQ0` will be sent to the processor as interrupt number `32d` instead of `8d` (as in the default mapping), `IRQ1` will be sent to the processor as interrupt number `33d` and so on. The second parameter tells the PIC (that we are initializing) to which of its slots the other PIC is connected. The third parameter tells the PIC which mode we would like it to run in. There are multiple modes for PIC devices, but the mode that we care about and need to use is the x86 mode. The fourth parameter tells the PIC which `IRQs` to enable and which to disable. Now, let's look at the code of the `remap_pic` routine which implements what we have just described by setting the correct parameters to the initialization command of both the master and the slave PICs:

```{.asm}
remap_pic:
	mov al, 11h
	
	send_init_cmd_to_pic_master:
		out 0x20, al
		
	send_init_cmd_to_pic_slave:
		out 0xa0, al
		
	; ... ;
	
	make_irq_start_from_intr_32_in_pic_master:
		mov al, 32d
		out 0x21, al
	
	make_irq_start_from_intr_40_in_pic_slave:
		mov al, 40d
		out 0xa1, al 
	
	; ... ;
	
	tell_pic_master_where_pic_slave_is_connected:
		mov al, 04h
		out 0x21, al
	
	tell_pic_slave_where_pic_master_is_connected:
		mov al, 02h
		out 0xa1, al
	
	; ... ;
	
	mov al, 01h
	
	tell_pic_master_the_arch_is_x86:
		out 0x21, al
	
	tell_pic_slave_the_arch_is_x86:
		out 0xa1, al
	
	; ... ;
	
	mov al, 0h
	
	make_pic_master_enable_all_irqs:
		out 0x21, al
	
	make_pic_slave_enable_all_irqs:
		out 0xa1, al
	
	; ... ;
	
	ret
```

Note that the labels here are optional, they were added for the sake of readability, you can get rid of them if you want. As you can see, the command and data port for both master and slave PICs are used to send the initialize command and the parameters. The instruction `out` can only take the register `AX` as second operand and due to that, the number that represent the command or the data that we would like to send are always set to `AL` first which is used later as the second operand of `out`. Also, it should be obvious that the first operand of `out` is the port number, while the second operand is the value that we would like to send.

![Master PIC's Data Format to Set The Place of Slave PIC](Figures/progenitor-ch/Fig27082021_0.png){#fig:27082021_0 width=50%}

You may ask, why the value is `4h` is used in the label `tell_pic_master_where_pic_slave_is_connected` ^[I just realized that this is a really long name! Sorry, sometimes I become a readability freak!] instead of `2h` since we said earlier that the slave PIC is connected to the master PIC through `IRQ2`. The reason of that is the data format that should be sent to the master PIC in order to tell it the place where the slave PIC is attached to. This format is shown in figure @fig:27082021_0 which shows that the size of the value is `1` byte and each `IRQ` is represented by one bit in this byte, that is, each bit is used as a flag to indicate which `IRQ` we would like to use.

![Slave PIC's Data Format to Set The Place of Master PIC](Figures/progenitor-ch/Fig27082021_1.png){#fig:27082021_1 width=50%}

In our case, the slave PIC is connected to the master PIC on the side of the master at `IRQ2` which is represented by bit `2`, which means the value of this bit should be `1` and all other bits should be `0`, this gives us the binary sequence `0000 0100` which is `4d`. If, for example, the slave PIC was connected to the master PIC through `IRQ7`, then the binary sequence would be `1000 0000`, which is `128d`. For the slave PIC, the format is shown in figure @fig:27082021_1 and as you can see, only bits `0` to `2` can be used while the others should be `0`. By using these three bits we can represent the number `8` at most, the normal way of representing the numbers can be used here. Because of that the value `2` is passed to the slave PIC to tell it that it is connected to master PIC through `IRQ2` in the label `tell_pic_slave_where_pic_master_is_connected`.

### Writing ISRs and Loading IDT
Now, everything is ready to write the code to load the `IDT` and the `ISR`s. The former is very simple and similar to the code of loading the `GDT` table, the following snippet shows the code of the `load_idt` routine:

```{.asm}
load_idt:
	lidt [idtr - start]
	ret
```

As you can see, there's nothing new here. The instruction `lidt` is used to load the content of the register `IDTR` by using the same calculation that we have already used in the previous routine `load_gdt`. Now, for the sake of organization, we're going to dedicate a new file for the data related to the `IDT` and the `ISR`s and this file will be called `idt.asm`. At the end of `starter.asm` the following line should be added: `%include "idt.asm"`, exactly as we did for `gdt.asm`.

We need to define at least `49` `ISR`s. The interrupts from `0d` to `31d` are used by the processor to indicate that some error happened in the system. In fact, interrupts `22d` to `31d` are reserved and have no use for us, but we need to fill their entries in the `IDT` table to be able to use the interrupts starting from `32d`. The interrupts `32d` to `48d` are now used by the PIC after the remapping for hardware interrupts (`IRQ`s). Hence, we need to fill the entries of all of these interrupts in the `IDT` to make sure that our kernel runs correctly. Right now, we are going to use the same skeleton for the `ISR`s that we are going to define, let's start with `isr_0` which is the name of the routine that handles the interrupt `0`. Starting from here, the shown code snippets should be put into the file `idt.asm` unless explicitly stated otherwise:

```{.asm}
isr_0:
	cli
	push 0
	jmp isr_basic
```

The code here is very simple, we first make sure that interrupts are disabled by using the instruction `cli`. While an interrupt handler is running, we don't want another interrupt to occur, it will be more obvious why this is important when we start to implement process management in the 539kernel.

After disabling the interrupts, we push the value `0` to the stack which is the number of the current interrupt. This pushed value will be used later by a C function that will receive it as a parameter ^[That's possible due to the calling convention as we have discussed earlier in the previous chapter \ref{ch-x86}.]. In this way, we can have just one C function that works as an interrupt handler for all interrupts by using a parameter that holds the interrupt number which should be handled. After pushing the interrupt number, the routine is going to jump to the label `isr_basic` which contains the basic code for all `ISR`s that we are going to define.

Now, for all other `ISR`s that are related to the processor, that is, for interrupts `1` to `31` we are going to use the exact same code. Only two things should be changed: the name of the routine should indicate the interrupt number, for example `isr_1` for interrupt `1`, `isr_2` for interrupt `2` and so on and the second change is the pushed value. We're not going to show you code for all `31` `ISR`s in here since it needs a lot of space, but you can always refer to the 539kernel's source code if the matter isn't clear. The following snippet shows an example of `ISR`s `1`, `2`, and `3`, the label `isr_basic` will be defined later on:

```{.asm}
isr_1:
	cli
	push 1
	jmp isr_basic
	
isr_2:
	cli
	push 2
	jmp isr_basic
	
isr_3:
	cli
	push 3
	jmp isr_basic
```

As we mentioned earlier, the second set of `ISR`s that should handle the `IRQ`s and the interrupt numbers starts from number `32` and goes to `48`. The following snippet shows an example of one of them which is `isr_32`:

```{.asm}
isr_32:
	cli
	push 32
	jmp irq_basic
```

It's exactly the same code as the one for `ISR`s before `32`, the only difference is the label that the routine jumps to. Here it's `irq_basic`, which is the basic implementation for all interrupts that are caused by `IRQ`s, hence, the code for `isr_33` till `isr_48` is the same as the one for `isr_32` with the only difference of the pushed value. The following snippet shows the implementation for `isr_basic`:

```{.asm}
isr_basic:
	call interrupt_handler
	
	pop eax
	
	sti
	iret
```

Here, `isr_basic` simply calls the function `interrupt_handler` which is a C function that is going to be defined in the main kernel code. To make `NASM` know that this function is defined somewhere else than in the assembly code, the line `extern interrupt_handler` should be added before `start` routine in `starter.asm`, exactly as we did for the function `kernel_main`.

After the function `interrupt_handler` returns, the stack of the current `ISR` is cleaned by eliminating the value that we have pushed which represents the number of the current interrupt. This is performed by using the `pop` instruction which requires an operand to store the popped value on it and for no particular reason we've chosen `EAX`. This is the simplest way of cleaning the stack's frame, another well known way is `add esp, 4` where the second operand is the size of all data that we have pushed on the frame and we would like to eliminate before return. In our case, the size of the number that we have pushed is `4` bytes. As you can see, the latter method of cleaning the stack is preferred since no place to store the popped value is needed and most probably you are going to encounter this method much more often in real code. For the sake of simplicity, we're going to keep the former method unless we actually need the latter method.

Finally, the `ISR` re-enables the interrupts with the instruction `sti` and returns by using the instruction `iret` instead of the normal `ret` that we have used before. The former one is the one that should be used by interrupt handlers to return. The following snippet shows the code of `irq_basic`:

```{.asm}
irq_basic:
	call interrupt_handler
	
	mov al, 0x20
	out 0x20, al
	
	cmp byte [esp], 40d
	jnge irq_basic_end
	
	mov al, 0xa0
	out 0x20, al
	
	irq_basic_end:
		pop eax
		
		sti
		iret
```

The fundamental functionality of `irq_basic` is the same as `isr_basic`, it calls the C function `interrupt_handler` and in the end it cleans the stack and returns (in label `irq_basic_end`). The question now is, what is this additional code between calling the C function and returning? As you know, `IRQ`s come from one of the PICs of the system, and this PIC requires to be told that the `IRQ` it sent has been handled. To do that the PIC command known as *end of interrupt* (`EOI`) should be used and that's what the code does.

The command `EOI` should be sent to the master PIC after handling all `IRQ`s (the ones that belong to the master and also the slave), but for the slave PIC this command should be sent only after the `IRQ`s of the slave PIC have been handled, that is, for interrupts number `40` till `48`. So, after returning from the C function `interrupt_handler`, the command `EOI` is sent immediately to the mater PIC. As you can see, we write the value `20h` to the port `20h`. The first value represents the `EOI` command, while the second value represents the command port of the master PIC as we learned earlier. After that, the interrupt number, that we have pushed on the stack at the beginning of the `ISR`, is used to check if the interrupt that we've handled is greater than or equal `40d`. If it's not the case, a jump is performed to `irq_basic_end`, otherwise, the `EOI` command is sent to the slave PIC through its command port `a0h`.

Now, we are ready to define the `IDT` table. To not take too much space we will show only the first three entries, but the full table should have `49` entries, all of them with exactly the same fields with the only difference in the label name of the `ISR` ^[The values of the properties here are used from the Basekernel project (<https://github.com/dthain/basekernel>).]:

```{.asm}
idt:
	dw isr_0, 8, 0x8e00, 0x0000
	dw isr_1, 8, 0x8e00, 0x0000
	dw isr_2, 8, 0x8e00, 0x0000
```

The meaning of the values of the fields are summarized in the following table:

| Handler's Name | Segment Selector  | Present | Privilege Level | Descriptor Size | Gate Type |
|----------------|-------------------|---------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------|
| isr_0          | 8 (Kernel's Code) | Yes     | 0               | 32-bit          | Interrupt |
| isr_1          | 8 (Kernel's Code) | Yes     | 0               | 32-bit          | Interrupt |
| isr_2          | 8 (Kernel's Code) | Yes     | 0               | 32-bit          | Interrupt |

Like in the `GDT` table, here's a Python script that lets you manipulate the properties of the descriptors from a human readable input. The code of the script is shown in the following snippet:

```{.python}
import json;

def generateIDTAsWords( idtAsJSON, nasmFormat = False ):
	idt = json.loads( idtAsJSON );
	idtAsWords = '';
	
	for entry in idt:
		if nasmFormat:
			idtAsWords += 'dw ';
		
		# ... #
		
		present = ( 1 if entry[ 'present' ] else 0 ) << 7;
		dpl = entry[ 'dpl' ] << 6;
		size = ( 1 if entry[ 'gate_descriptor_size' ] == '32-bit' else 0 ) << 3;
		gateType = ( 0 if entry[ 'interrupt_gate' ] else 1 );
		
		byteFive = present | dpl | ( 0 << 11 ) | size | ( 1 << 2 ) | ( 1 << 1 ) | gateType;
		
		wordThree = '0x' + format( byteFive, 'x' ).zfill( 2 ) + '00';
		
		# ... #
		
		idtAsWords += entry[ 'isr_routine_name' ] + ', ' + str( entry[ 'isr_segment_selector' ] ) + ', ' + wordThree + ', 0x0000'  + '\n';
		
	return idtAsWords;
```

The following snippet shows an example of using `generateIDTAsWords`:

```{.python}
idt = '''
[
	{ 	"isr_routine_name": "isr_0", "isr_segment_selector": 8, "present": true, "dpl": 0, "gate_descriptor_size": "32-bit", "interrupt_gate": true },
	{ 	"isr_routine_name": "isr_1", "isr_segment_selector": 8, "present": true, "dpl": 0, "gate_descriptor_size": "32-bit", "interrupt_gate": true }
]
''';

print( generateIDTAsWords( idt, True ) );
```

After defining the entries of `IDT`, we can define the label `idtr` which will be the value that we will load in the special register `IDTR`:

```{.asm}
idtr:
	idt_size_in_bytes	: 	dw idtr - idt
	idt_base_address	: 	dd idt
```

It should now be easy to understand why `idtr - idt` gives us the size of the `IDT` in bytes. Also, you should know that if the label `idtr` is not right below the label `idt` this won't work. We've used this method instead of hardcoding the size of the table `8 * 49 = 392` in the code to make sure that we don't forget to change the size field when adding a new entry to the `IDT`, you are free to hardcode the size as we did in `gdtr` if you like to. Finally, the C function `interrupt_handler` can be defined at the end of `main.c`:

```{.c}
void interrupt_handler( int interrupt_number )
{
	println();
	print( "Interrupt Received " );
	printi( interrupt_number );
}
```

It simply receives the interrupt number as a parameter, as you have expected, and prints this number in an appealing way.

And now we have got the progenitor of the 539kernel! Compiling and running this code is going to print the messages `Welcome to 539kernel!` then `We are now in Protected-mode` then `539` and finally, our first interrupt will be received and the message `Interrupt Received 32` will be printed on the screen. This interrupt won't be received just once since it is the interrupt of the system timer the kernel will keep receiving it and print the same message every given unit of time. We will use the system timer later when we start discussing the scheduling of processes in chapter \ref{ch-process-management}.

## Quick Review of the Changes in the Makefile
As you may have noticed, the `Makefile` of the progenitor version of 539kernel has some different aspects than the one that we have used in the bootloader version of 539kernel. The first difference is the way that we assemble `starter.asm`. As you can see, unlike for `bootstrap.asm`, the output of the process of assembling the starter is an `ELF32` binary file instead of flat binary file. As you know, the code of the starter is related to the C code of 539kernel, that is, there are C functions that are called in the starter code. To make the starter able to reach this C code correctly, the binary output of both `starter.asm` and `main.c` should be linked. It is then the responsibility of the linker to generate a final binary file that understands what the starter refers to when it calls the C function `interrupt_handler`, for example. If we don't link the two files together, the starter will never know the location of the code of `interrupt_handler` or `kernel_main`.

To link two binary files, they should have the same format. This format makes it possible to link the files together. GCC generates `ELF` binary files by default, so, when we assemble `starter.asm` we tell `NASM` to generate an `ELF` file. After that the resulting binary files (AKA: object files) of both `starter.asm` and `main.c` are linked by using the command `ld`. We tell the linker that we are linking `ELF` object files. The order of the files that we pass to the linker to link is important, as you can see `starter.o` is passed before `kernel.elf`, which makes the linker put the code of the starter before the code of the main kernel in the resulting `ELF` binary file `539kernel.elf`. Because `ELF` is not executable by the processor directly unless some code interprets it, we convert it to a flat binary file by using the command `objcopy`. This way, the bootloader can load the kernel without the need of dealing with the details of the `ELF` format. 

Also, you can see that the final image of the kernel `kernel.img` is generated by writing the contents of bootloader first, then the kernel, and then the image is filled with around `1MB` of zeros. While the last step isn't necessary for QEMU, if you decide to use Bochs instead, this step is required. While we are going to stick with the former one right now, the latter one, in my humble opinion, has better debugging tools.

Another important aspect of the new `Makefile` are the flags that are passed to GCC. We need to be careful with these flags and pass the correct ones to make sure that GCC compiles our kernel correctly since GCC compiles user-space applications by default. The flag `-Wall` tells GCC to show us the warnings in our code. The flag `-m32` makes GCC generate `32-bit` code. The flag `-c` stops the linker from running by default since we are going to run it later manually with specific options as you have seen. The flag `-ffreestanding` indicates that we are compiling code that doesn't rely or need C's standard library and neither the `main` function necessary for it. Both flags `-fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables`, `-fno-pie`, and `-fno-stack-protector` are used to eliminate some extra code that is generated by GCC to handle some situations that are related to user-space code. This is a quick review of the functionality of the flags and you can always refer to GCC's official documentation ^[https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs] for more details.

## A Traditionalist Implementer or a Kernelist?
Most probably you are now objecting, "**kernelist** is not even a word!". I know, even my poor spell checker is shocked! Just bear with me a little bit and let me show you what I mean by the term *kernelist*. 

In our journey of creating an operating system kernel we may ask ourselves, what is our role exactly? There are two possible roles that I would like to focus on, the first one is being a traditionalist implementer (for short: traditionalist). What I mean when saying traditionalist is that this is the developer who writes the code of the kernel without focusing too much on the design of the kernel and the philosophical questions about that kernel. Examples of such questions are: "What is the problem that the kernel will solve?", "How to design its architecture to accomplish its goal?" and so on. Also the traditionalist tends to implement already well-known solutions that have been used for many years with no or little changes. The kernelist, on the other hand, is the person who focuses on questions about the kernel's design and the new solutions for these problems and tries to answer these questions and presents a suitable kernel's design and custom or novel solutions for specific problems. For example, writing a Unix-like kernel is the job of a traditionalist, since the architecture of Unix is already designed by kernelists to solve specific problems.

Our goal from this book is to **learn** how to write an operating system kernel with a traditional design and no new ideas, so, we are taking the role of a traditionalist. The design of the 539kernel is very simple and it solves no specific problem in a novel way, instead it uses the concepts that are already well-known and used by many operating systems as you will see in the next chapters. Also, it doesn't focus on some new problems to solve nor new solutions for old problems. This makes the 539kernel a working kernel that solves the same problems that other kernels solve by using the same solutions that other kernels use. The advantage of this design is that it makes the 539kernel easy to implement which means it is a good starting point to learn about operating system kernels and that's the goal of this book.

The natural question for someone, who would like to continue in the journey of operating system kernels, is to ask oneself after implementing a basic kernel, "What's next?" and here's where a kernelist is born! In fact, there are many real world problems in computing that need to be solved, also, there are many innovative ideas that need to be created, furthermore, there are many good ideas that have been presented by someone else but need to be realized in real world systems. A lot of the aforementioned can be found in the scientific papers ^[In fact, I've started a project that generalizes this thought and I called it `ResearchCoders`. If you are interested in finding and implementing new ideas that solve real-world problems maybe you'd like to check the website of the project (<https://researchcoders.dev>)].

The kernelist doesn't necessarily create innovative solutions by himself, but he can use modern solutions that have been proposed by other kernelists to design and implement a kernel with modern, innovative, and useful ideas instead of reimplementing the traditional solutions that have been with us for the last `60` years over and over again.

If after having read this book and after having learned about how to create a kernel you would like to continue the journey, I encourage you to consider the role of a kernelist. Using what you have learned to solve real-world problems is a good idea, and the world needs this kind of orientation. Although this is a book of a traditionalist more than a kernelist, I've dedicated chapter \ref{ch-what-is-next} for those who would like to, at least, take a look at what it means to be a kernelist.
